# Python-React Music Player (Zune Nostalgia)

<p>Nostalgic for the Microsoft Zune player, I'm creating my own desktop media player as an offline web app using this awesome 
front-end https://javapyscript.github.io/zunePlayer/#/music/ARTISTS as inspiration along 
with Eel, Python, and SQL Lite db. </p>
<p>I'm also a implementing a "Context" feature which uses a Wikipedia Python wrapper that searches
for Wiki pages using the release year. For eg. a song released in 1979 would grab pages related to historical
events occuring the same year.</p>
