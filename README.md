# Python-React Music Player (Zune Nostalgia)

Nostalgic for the Microsoft Zune player, I'm creating my own desktop media player as an offline web app using this awesome 
front-end https://javapyscript.github.io/zunePlayer/#/music/ARTISTS as inspiration along 
with Eel, Python, and SQL Lite db.

 - [ ] Basic player functionality
	 - [x] play, pause, resume
	 - [x] next, previous song
	 - [ ] volume controls
- Use jinja templates to render
	- [x] tracks
	- [x] albums
	- [x] artists
 - [ ] Use Eel and jinja for rendering changes to UI
	 - [x] loading image on song now playing
	 - [ ] layout switching on tab selection
 - [ ] Keep track of state
 - [x] Install sqllite db to use for storing filepath references
 - [ ] Ability to load files on user selection of music directories
 - [ ] Add pre-made music visualizers
